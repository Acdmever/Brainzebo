- Look at Max SDK - how to build objectsâ€¦. 
- Hook up VPs to AUMI.
    - Get VP info from Ian
    
11-Oct 2017

## Projects etc.

- UH research: Max objects, integrate with AUMI, granular synth control, 3D audio mixing and production
- Tacton experiment: feasibility and pilots for redoing/building on Marcello's tacton study (for publication in TENOR?)
- Haptics integration: AUMI (with VP and UH)
- CHI workshop participation - pending... 

## Recap from last week: 

#### Aditya: 

- Building Max objects - can't compile objects with Ultrahaptics (UH) libraries linked. Architecture mismatch. 
- Looking to build with OSC instead. 

#### Johnny: 

- Got VibroPixel (VP) info from Ian to address units. Now can test for tacton belt and AUMI integration. 
- Learning C++ and XCode to get current on UH dev. 

## Skype call with Marcello:

Tacton experiment - Feasibility for a new experiment/lessons learned from original:

- Keep new experiment simple and consistent with the original
- Major problems:
    + Different instruments
    + Different participant musical level
    + 2 sessions not enough to see any trends
    + Music was very easy, need passages that are more challenging? (Need expert level participants)
- Multiple sessions - would be ready this term - 
    + can do pilots now
    + Full study in the winter
- Idea for the study -
    + Something like "40 Icons" - a piece made of 10 different sections with different dynamics/difficulty levels
    + After 5 weeks can participants perform piece correctly - sections randomized - with correct articulations, dynamics
    + Train with them once a week for an hour
    + Use piano (MIDI data), easy to analyze (tempo, correct notes, dynamics)
- Number of participants? 5 - 6 maybe? 
    + Booking them for 1 hour per week might be tough, and a lot of time
    + Pay them...?

CHI workshop:

- UH submitting proposal for organizing a session around mid-air haptics
    + Organizers: Stephen Brewster - Glasgow; someone from Korea (AR piano w/ UH)
    + Submitting this Friday; will know in November. 
    + Can submit something with Max objects - would be good. 

Compiling Max objects for UH: 

- Max objects need to compile for i386 architecture, while UH API specifies x64. 
- Aditya will send logs to Marcello; he and UH devs will look into it. 
- Using XCode, Marcello uses CMake.. 


## Next steps (for next week?): 

- Tacton Experiment: 
    + Make a basic plan/timeline for the study and send to Marcello for input
    + Implement a test VP belt. 
    + Organize some pilots (test VP vs Bodysuit belt)
- UltraHaptics: 
    + UH team will look at logfiles to see if Max object compilation can work
    + Will work with OSC implementation (oscpack - http://www.rossbencina.com/code/oscpack?q=~rossb/code/oscpack/) - could also try libmapper
    + Check with Johnty about architectures/OSC/libmapper implementation
- VP/AUMI: 
    + Test VP addressing
    + Working AUMI demo and tacton belt

## General long term scheduling: 

- October:
    + Tech tests, getting things running
- November: 
    + Pilots
    + Organize tacton study for winter
    + CHI workshop proposal
- December: 
    + recruiting
- January/February:
    + Run tacton study
- March: 
    + CHI workshop
- Spring: 
    + publish tacton study results
